Current issue:

Permutation of length 8, in least ideal starting order, seems to not find a solution
Example: For length 7, something like 7 3 1 5 2 4 6 takes about 7-8 seconds to complete
	 because every number is in the wrong spot and none of them have correct neighbors
	 either.
	 Now, if we did something like 8 4 2 5 3 7 1 6...it seems to hang forever.  I think
	 at one point it did complete after about 2 minutes but it wasn't with this exact
	 starting order of numbers.  I have to stop the process for fear of maxing out Blue's
	 storage space, lol, but I've let it run for probably 4-5 minutes with no solution.
	 It doesn't seem like 8 numbers should take that long when 7 took only 7-8 seconds.
	 Anyway, that's where I'm at.
